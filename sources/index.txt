Marauder's Map Client documentation
====================================
Welcome! This is the documentation for the Marauder's Map Client, last updated |today|.

The client is a laptop application that broadcasts the signal strength of nearby wireless network nodes
to the Marauder's Map Server, which maps the set of signal strengths to a physical coordinate and updates a map
that displays the locations of users.
